    <h2>Our History</h2>
    <p>Bellevue ARC was founded in 1952 by a group of parents who were determined to create better opportunities for their children with intellectual and developmental disabilities. What began as a small grassroots organization has grown into a comprehensive service provider that supports hundreds of individuals and families in the Bellevue area.</p>

    <p>Over the decades, we have evolved to meet changing needs and embrace new philosophies of care. We have moved from institutional models to community-based services, always keeping the individual at the center of everything we do.</p>
